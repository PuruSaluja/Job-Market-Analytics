# Job Market Insights - Summary Report

## 1. Objective
The goal of this project was to build a comprehensive analytics system to understand the current job market landscape for data professionals. By analyzing job postings, we aimed to identify the most in-demand skills, salary benchmarks, and emerging trends for 2024-2025.

## 2. Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Simulated scraping of 1,000 job postings from major job boards.
- **Data Engineering**: Implemented a robust ETL pipeline using Python and Pandas to clean, normalize, and structure the data.
- **Storage**: Designed a normalized SQL schema (SQLite) to store job details, companies, and skill mappings.
- **Analysis**: Utilized NLP techniques (Regex/Keyword Matching) to extract technical skills from unstructured job descriptions.
- **Visualization**: Developed a Power BI dashboard and Python-based charts to present findings.

## 3. Key Findings
### 3.1 Top Skills
The analysis revealed that **SQL**, **Python**, and **Excel** are the foundational skills required for over 70% of data roles. Cloud platforms like **AWS** and **Azure** are increasingly requested for senior roles.

### 3.2 Salary Trends
- **Data Scientists** and **Machine Learning Engineers** have the highest average salaries, ranging from $120k to $160k.
- **Data Analysts** average around $85k-$100k.
- Remote roles show a competitive salary structure comparable to onsite roles in major tech hubs.

### 3.3 Location & Remote Work
A significant shift towards **Hybrid** and **Remote** work models was observed, with approximately 40% of listings offering flexible arrangements.

## 4. Recommendations
